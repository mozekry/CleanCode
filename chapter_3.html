    <h1>Chapter 3: Functions</h1>
    <h2>Functions Attribut</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Small
        <ul>
          <li>Function should be two, or three, or four lines long, transparently obvious,
             <br>told a story and led you to the next in a compelling order.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Blocks and Indenting
        <ul>
          <li>Blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and
so on should be one line long.<br> Probably that line should be a function call.</li>
          <li>Functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures.<br>
Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Do One Thing
        <ul>
          <li>Functions should do one thing. they should do it well.<br>they should do it only.</li>
          <li>One level of abstraction below the stated name of the function.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Has Descriptive Names
        <ul>
          <li>Choose function name that tell exactly what the function do.</li>
          <li>Be consistent in your names. Use the same phrases, nouns,<br> and verbs in the function
names you choose for your modules</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <li>Have No Side Effects
<ul>
  <li>Function should do one thing, but it also does other hidden
things <br>
examples:
<ul>
  <li>make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class.</li>
  <li>make unexpected changes to the parameters passed into the function or to system globals.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Command Query Separation <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. <br>
        example: <code>public boolean set(String attribute, String value);</code> <br>
        This leads to odd statements like this:
        <code>if (set("username", "unclebob"))...</code> <br>
        Is it asking whether the “username” attribute was previously set to “unclebob”? <br> Or is it asking whether the
        “username” attribute was successfully set to “unclebob”? <br>
        The real solution is to separate the command from the query<br>
        <code><pre>if (attributeExists("username")) {
        setAttribute("username", "unclebob");...}</pre> </code></li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Function Arguments</h2>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>The ideal number of arguments for a function is
    zero (niladic).<br>Next comes one (monadic), followed
    closely by two (dyadic). <br>Three arguments (triadic)
    should be avoided where possible. <br>More than three
    (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.
    <ul>
    <li>Common Monadic Forms (Single Argument Function):
      <ol>
        <li>Asking a question about that argument.<br>
            example: boolean fileExists(“MyFile”){}
        </li>
        <li>Transforming the argument into something else and RETURN it.<br>
          example:
          <code><pre>
InputStream fileOpen(“MyFile”){
  InputStream stream;
  //body
  return stream;
  }
</pre></code>
         </li>
         <li>Flag Argument
           <ul>
             <li>Passing a boolean into a function is a terrible practice<br>
                because it does one thing if the flag is true and another if false <br>
                instead we should split the function into two <br>
                examples: void whenTrue(){} and void whenFalse(){}
             </li>
           </ul>


         </li>
      </ol>

    </li>
  <li>Dyadic Functions (Double Argument Function)
  <ul>
    <li>There are times, where two arguments are appropriate.<br>
    example: Point p = new Point(0,0); is reasonable <br>
    because thay are ordered components of a single value
   </li>
   <li>Should think of mechanims to convert them into monads. <br>
     example of convert writeField(output-Stream, name) into monadic: <ol>
       <li>Make the writeField method a member of outputStream so that you can say <br>
       outputStream.writeField(name).</li>
       <li>Make the outputStream a member variable of the current
  class so that you don’t have to pass it.</li>
  <li>Extract a new class like FieldWriter
that takes the outputStream in its constructor and has a write method.</li>
     </ol></li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Triadic Functions (Triple Argument Function)

<ul>
  <li>When a function seems to need three or more arguments, likely some of
arguments should be wrapped into a class of their own.<br>
example: the difference between the two following declarations:
<pre>
Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
    </ul>

</li>
<li>Output Arguments
<ul>
  <li>Output arguments should be avoided. <br> If your function must change the state
of something, have it change the state of its owning object.
<br>example: when you see this function call <code>appendFooter(s);</code><br>
Does this function append s as the footer to something? <br> Or does it append some footer
to s? Is s an input or an output? <br>
so we have to see the function declaration <code>void appendFooter(StringBuffer report)</code><br>
it would be better for <code>appendFooter</code> to be invoked as <br>
<code>report.appendFooter();</code>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Switch Statement in Functions</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Bury the switch statement in the basement of an ABSTRACT FACTORY<br>
    example:<code><pre>
public abstract class Employee {
  public abstract boolean isPayday();
  public abstract Money calculatePay();
  public abstract void deliverPay(Money pay);
}
public interface EmployeeFactory {
  public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws InvalidEmployeeType;
}
public class EmployeeFactoryImpl implements EmployeeFactory {
  public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws InvalidEmployeeType {
    switch (r.type) {
      case COMMISSIONED:
        return new CommissionedEmployee(r) ;
      case HOURLY:
        return new HourlyEmployee(r);
      case SALARIED:
        return new SalariedEmploye(r);
      default:
      throw new InvalidEmployeeType(r.type);
    }}}</pre></code>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Exceptions in Functions</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes
    <ul type="square">
      <li>This lead to deeply nested structures, when you return an error code, <br>
you create the problem that the caller must deal with the error immediately <br>
example: <code><pre>
if (deletePage(page) == E_OK) {
  if (configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey()) == E_OK){
      logger.log("page deleted");
    } else {logger.log("configKey not deleted");}
} else {logger.log("delete failed")};
return E_ERROR;</pre></code>
should be
<pre>try {
deletePage(page);
registry.deleteReference(page.name);
configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey());
}
catch (Exception e) {
logger.log(e.getMessage());
}</pre>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Extract Try/Catch Blocks
    <ul>
      <li>Extract the bodies of the try and catch blocks out into functions of their own. <br>
        example:
        <pre>public void delete(Page page) {
try {
deletePageAndAllReferences(page);
}
catch (Exception e) {
logError(e);
}
}</pre>
       </li>
       <li>Function that handles
errors should do nothing else. if the keyword
try exists in a function, <br> it should be the very first word in the function and that there
should be nothing after the catch/finally blocks</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

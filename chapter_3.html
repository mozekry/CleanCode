    <h1>Chapter 3: Functions</h1>
    <h2>Functions Attribut</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Small
        <ul>
          <li>Function should be two, or three, or four lines long, transparently obvious,
             <br>told a story and led you to the next in a compelling order.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Blocks and Indenting
        <ul>
          <li>Blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and
so on should be one line long.<br> Probably that line should be a function call.</li>
          <li>Functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures.<br>
Therefore, the indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Do One Thing
        <ul>
          <li>Functions should do one thing. they should do it well.<br>they should do it only.</li>
          <li>One level of abstraction below the stated name of the function.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Has Descriptive Names
        <ul>
          <li>Choose function name that tell exactly what the function do.</li>
          <li>Be consistent in your names. Use the same phrases, nouns,<br> and verbs in the function
names you choose for your modules</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <li>Have No Side Effects
<ul>
  <li>function should do one thing, but it also does other hidden
things <br>
examples:
<ul>
  <li>make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class.</li>
  <li>make unexpected changes to the parameters passed into the function or to system globals.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Function Arguments</h2>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>The ideal number of arguments for a function is
    zero (niladic).<br>Next comes one (monadic), followed
    closely by two (dyadic). <br>Three arguments (triadic)
    should be avoided where possible. <br>More than three
    (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.</li>
    <li>Common Monadic Forms (Single Argument Function):
      <ol>
        <li>Asking a question about that argument.<br>
            example: boolean fileExists(“MyFile”){}
        </li>
        <li>Transforming the argument into something else and RETURN it.<br>
          example:
          <code><pre>
InputStream fileOpen(“MyFile”){
  InputStream stream;
  //body
  return stream;
  }
</pre></code>
         </li>
         <li>Flag Argument
           <ul>
             <li>Passing a boolean into a function is a terrible practice<br>
                because it does one thing if the flag is true and another if false <br>
                instead we should split the function into two <br>
                examples: void whenTrue(){} and void whenFalse(){}
             </li>
           </ul>


         </li>
      </ol>

    </li>
  <li>Dyadic Functions (Double Argument Function)
  <ul>
    <li>There are times, where two arguments are appropriate.<br>
    example: Point p = new Point(0,0); is reasonable <br>
    because thay are ordered components of a single value
   </li>
   <li>Should think of mechanims to convert them into monads. <br>
     example of convert writeField(output-Stream, name) into monadic: <ol>
       <li>Make the writeField method a member of outputStream so that you can say <br>
       outputStream.writeField(name).</li>
       <li>Make the outputStream a member variable of the current
  class so that you don’t have to pass it.</li>
  <li>Extract a new class like FieldWriter
that takes the outputStream in its constructor and has a write method.</li>
     </ol></li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Triadic Functions (Triple Argument Function)

<ul>
  <li>When a function seems to need three or more arguments, likely some of
arguments should be wrapped into a class of their own.<br>
example: the difference between the two following declarations:
<pre>
Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Switch Statement in Function</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Bury the switch statement in the basement of an ABSTRACT FACTORY<br>
    example:<code> <pre>
public abstract class Employee {
  public abstract boolean isPayday(); public abstract Money calculatePay();
  public abstract void deliverPay(Money pay);
}
public interface EmployeeFactory {
  public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws InvalidEmployeeType;
}
public class EmployeeFactoryImpl implements EmployeeFactory {
  public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws InvalidEmployeeType {
    switch (r.type) {
      case COMMISSIONED:
        return new CommissionedEmployee(r) ;
      case HOURLY:
        return new HourlyEmployee(r);
      case SALARIED:
        return new SalariedEmploye(r);
      default:
      throw new InvalidEmployeeType(r.type);
    }}}</pre></code>
  </li>
</ul>

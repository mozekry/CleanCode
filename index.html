  <h2>Variables Names</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>1- Choose names that answer these questions:
      	<ul>
          <li>-why it exists?</li>
          <li>-what it does?</li>
          <li>-how it is used?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  2- Avoid Disinformation:
  	Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it is actually a List
  3- Make Meaningful Distinctions:
  	If names must be different, then they should also mean something different
  4- Use Pronounceable Names:
  	If you can't pronounce it, you can not discuss it without sounding like an idiot
  5- Use Searchable Names:
  	Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not
  	easy to locate across a body of text
  6- Avoid Encodings
  7- Avoid Mental Mapping
  	Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names they already
  	know. This problem generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms
  	nor solution domain terms
  *****Class Names*****
  Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage,
  Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name
  of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

  *****Method Names*****
  1- Methods should have verb or verb phrase names
  2- When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that
  	describe the arguments. For example,
  	Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
  	is generally better than
  	Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);

  *****General*****
  1- Don't Be Cute
  	Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
  2- Pick One Word per Concept
  	Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it's confusing to
  	have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes
  3- Don't Pun(use multiple meanings of a term)
  	Avoid using the same word for two purposes
  4- Use Solution Domain Names
  	The name AccountVisitor means a great deal to a programmer who is familiar with
  	the VISITOR pattern. What programmer would not know what a JobQueue was?
  5- Use Problem Domain Names
  	When there is no "programmer-eese" for what you're doing, use the name from the problem
  	domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert
  	what it means
  6- Add Meaningful Context
  	place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named
  	classes, functions, or namespaces
  7- Don't Add Gratuitous Context
  	Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no
  	more context to a name than is necessary

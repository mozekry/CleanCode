    <h1>Chapter 2: Meaningful Names</h1>
  <h2>Variables Names</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose names that answer these questions:
      	<ul type="circle">
          <li>why it exists?</li>
          <li>what it does?</li>
          <li>how it is used?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid Disinformation
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it is actually a List</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Make Meaningful Distinctions
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>If names must be different, then they should also mean something different</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Use Pronounceable Names
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>If you can't pronounce it, you can not discuss it without sounding like an idiot</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Use Searchable Names
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Avoid Encodings</li>
    <li>Avoid Mental Mapping
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names they already
  know. <br>This problem generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms
  nor solution domain terms</li>
</ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
<h2>Class Names</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage,
  Account, and AddressParser.<br> Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name
  of a class. A class name should not be a verb.</li>
</ul>


  <h2>Method Names</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Methods should have verb or verb phrase names</li>
    <li>When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that
    	describe the arguments.<br>For example,
    	Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);<br>
    	is generally better than
    	Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>General</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Don't Be Cute
      <ul>
        <li>Say what you mean. Mean what you say.</li>
      </ul>
    	</li>
    <li>Pick One Word per Concept
      <ul>
        <li>Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it's confusing to
      	have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes</li>
      </ul>
    	</li>
    <li>Don't Pun(use multiple meanings of a term)
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid using the same word for two purposes</li>
      </ul>
    	</li>
    <li>Use Solution Domain Names
      <ul>
        <li>The name AccountVisitor means a great deal to a programmer who is familiar with
      	the VISITOR pattern. What programmer would not know what a JobQueue was?</li>
      </ul>
    	</li>
    <li>Use Problem Domain Names
      <ul>
        <li>When there is no "programmer-eese" for what you're doing, use the name from the problem
        	domain.<br>At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert
        	what it means</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add Meaningful Context
      <ul>
        <li>place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named
      	classes, functions, or namespaces</li>
      </ul>
    	</li>
    <li>Don't Add Gratuitous Context
      <ul>
        <li>Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no
      	more context to a name than is necessary</li>
      </ul>
    	</li>
